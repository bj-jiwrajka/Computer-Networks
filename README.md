## Getting Started

To get started with the codes in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
git clone git remote add origin https://github.com/bj-jiwrajka/Computer-Networks.git

2. **Navigate to a Specific Lab Exercise or Project**:
cd Computer-Networks/ExperimentX

3. **Compile and Run the Code**

## Usage

This repository includes code for the following lab experiments:

1. **TCP Client-Server Architecture**  
   Implement a Client-Server socket program in C to retrieve information (any text or system info) from a TCP server to a TCP client.

2. **TCP Chat Server**  
   Implement a Client-Server socket program in C where two client systems connect to a central server for communication or chat.

3. **Go-Back-N Protocol**  
   Implement a socket program to demonstrate the Go-Back-N Protocol using TCP.

4. **Echo Client and Echo Server using UDP**  
   Implement an Echo Client and Server using UDP to estimate the round trip time. The server should be capable of handling multiple connections simultaneously.

5. **Connectionless Iterative Service**  
   Write a program where the server calculates the factorial of a number sent by the client and sends it back.

6. **FTP Server**  
   Implement a Client-Server socket program in C to create an FTP server using TCP. The server will send a saved text file to the client upon request.

7. **Remote Command Execution**  
   Implement a program for remote command execution using sockets. The client sends a command to the server, which executes it and sends back the result.

8. **Web Server**  
   Write a program to implement a Web Server where the client requests a web page stored on the server.
