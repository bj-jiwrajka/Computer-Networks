#EXPLANATION

Header Files Inclusion:

stdio.h: Standard I/O functions.
stdlib.h: Standard library functions like memory allocation and process control.
string.h: String manipulation functions.
unistd.h: POSIX API for various system calls including read(), write(), and close().
arpa/inet.h: Definitions for Internet operations.

Constant Definitions:

PORT: The port number (8080) on which the server listens for client connections.
Main Function:

The program starts execution from the main() function.
Socket Creation:

The program creates a socket using the socket() function, which returns a socket file descriptor (server_fd).

Socket Options:

The program sets socket options using setsockopt() to allow reusing the same address and port quickly if the server is restarted.
Server Address Configuration:

The server address (address) is configured with IP address INADDR_ANY (meaning the server listens on all available network interfaces) and the specified port number.
Binding:

The socket is bound to the server address using bind() function. If the binding fails, an error message is printed and the program exits.
Listening:

The program listens for incoming client connections using listen() function, with a maximum queue length of 2 pending connections.
Accepting Client Connections:

The program enters a loop and accepts the first client connection using the accept() function, which returns a new socket file descriptor (client1_fd) for communicating with the first client.
It then prints a message indicating the first client is connected.
The program then accepts a second client connection in the same way, obtaining another socket file descriptor (client2_fd) for the second client.
Message Exchange Loop:

The program enters an infinite loop where messages are exchanged between the two clients.
For each iteration of the loop:
The buffer is cleared using memset() to ensure it's empty.
Data is received from client1_fd using recv() and then printed to the server's console.
The received data is sent to client2_fd using send().
The buffer is cleared again.
Data is received from client2_fd, printed, and then sent to client1_fd.
Returning from Main:

The program will only exit if there's an error during socket creation, binding, listening, or client connection acceptance.
